## Get started in a few steps

To get your first pattern up and spawning, follow these simple steps.

### Step 1: Creating required assets

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Creating a datatable for GameplayTags" icon="table">
    GridCast uses GameplayTags as identifiers for different chains, you can structure you tags however you want. These can be elements like fire, ice and thunder if you want but I like to name them in a generic manner so the same tags can be used for multiple patterns and the context of where they are being used can give more meaning to those generic names.

    Follow these steps to add a new datatable to your project with these GameplayTags:

    1. Right-click in the content browser -\> Miscellaneous.
    2. Pick GameplayTagTableRow.
    3. Open it, in the RowName you can type the name of the chain for example "IceChain" and then the value for it should be "Chain.Ice".
    4. Fill it up with chain names as per your needs and then go to Edit-\>Project Settings.
    5. Under project on the left, find "GameplayTags." Clicking it, there should be an option for array of "GameplayTagTableList".
    6. Click on the \+ icon and select your datatable here.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using pre-made datable for GameplayTags" icon="table">
    For users who don't want to create their own datatable of tags, you can use the one that comes as part of the plugin itself. These are what I personally used and they are named in a very generic manner.

    1. On the bar on top of the search bar in the content browser, there's a settings button with a gear option. Click it and check "Show Engine Content, Show Plugin Content."
    2. Go to Edit-\>Project Settings. Under project on the left, find "GameplayTags." Clicking it, there should be an option for array of "GameplayTagTableList".
    3. Click on the \+ icon and select "DT_GridCastChainTags" datatable here.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Creating your GridCastPattern Asset" icon="grid">
    1. Right click in the Content Browser, look for GridCast.
    2. It has only one option right now, GridCastPattern. Select it.
    3. Name it whatever you like and open it up.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Adding your chains

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Grid and Adding Chains" icon="github">
    1. In the details panel is a single variable, this is the size of your grid, it can only be an odd number, right now, it's capped between 3 and 21. Consider changing it before drawing your pattern. The top bar of buttons has a refresh button, hit it after you decide on a grid size, the default 7 tends to work quite well.
    2. At the top left of the editor, there's a button for adding new chains, "\+ Add Chain."
    3. Clicking it brings up the dialog to select details about it. You need to select a Chain Tag, a Chain Shape Type and a Chain Color.
    4. Chain color is used for debug and in the UI to identify chains.
    5. Hit add, this will add the first chain to this new pattern.
    6. Now you can add a couple more or continue with drawing your first pattern.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Drawing your pattern

<Accordion title="Drawing in GridCast" icon="rocket">
  1. There's a drop down at the top to select a chain, if you just added a new chain, the first chain in the pattern will be selected automatically, use this to select between different chains if you have multiple ones in your pattern.
  2. After selecting a current chain, the input for drawing a shape depends on the shape type you pick. If you chain is of circle type, simply click any of the cells on the grid and a circle should appear there. Clicking again would remove the circle. This is how you draw for circle shaped patterns.
  3. If you chose Line as a shape, clicking a cell will first select the starting point of the line, clicking another cell will form a line pointing in it's direction. If you've already clicked to select a starting cell and then you click the starting cell again, it will cancel the line. If you want to remove a particular line, just click it's start cell and then the end cell. Basically draw it again on top of itself and it will be removed.
  4. The only thing that's really important to rememeber is the the sequence you draw the pattern in. Since it works based on array, the order you draw the points on the grid is the order they will be processed in. Refer to Processing Types for more details.
  5. That's it\! It really is that simple. Draw the kind of pattern you want, when you're done, save and you're ready to test the pattern.
  6. There's also a button to draw points randomly, it's not a complex method, feel free to play around with it.
