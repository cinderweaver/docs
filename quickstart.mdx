## Get started in a few steps

To get your first pattern up and spawning, follow these simple steps.

### Step 1: Creating required assets

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Creating a datatable for GameplayTags" icon="table">
    GridCast uses GameplayTags as identifiers for different chains, you can structure you tags however you want. These can be elements like fire, ice and thunder if you want but I like to name them in a generic manner so the same tags can be used for multiple patterns and the context of where they are being used can give more meaning to those generic names.

    Follow these steps to add a new datatable to your project with these GameplayTags:

    1. Right-click in the content browser -\> Miscellaneous.
    2. Pick GameplayTagTableRow.
    3. Open it, in the RowName you can type the name of the chain for example "IceChain" and then the value for it should be "Chain.Ice".
    4. Fill it up with chain names as per your needs and then go to Edit-\>Project Settings.
    5. Under project on the left, find "GameplayTags." Clicking it, there should be an option for array of "GameplayTagTableList".
    6. Click on the \+ icon and select your datatable here.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using pre-made datable for GameplayTags" icon="table">
    For users who don't want to create their own datatable of tags, you can use the one that comes as part of the plugin itself. These are what I personally used and they are named in a very generic manner.

    1. On the bar on top of the search bar in the content browser, there's a settings button with a gear option. Click it and check "Show Engine Content, Show Plugin Content."
    2. Go to Edit-\>Project Settings. Under project on the left, find "GameplayTags." Clicking it, there should be an option for array of "GameplayTagTableList".
    3. Click on the \+ icon and select "DT_GridCastChainTags" datatable here.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Creating your GridCastPattern Asset" icon="grid">
    1. Right click in the Content Browser, look for GridCast.
    2. It has only one option right now, GridCastPattern. Select it.
    3. Name it whatever you like and open it up.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Adding your chains

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Grid and Adding Chains" icon="link">
    1. In the details panel is a single variable, this is the size of your grid, it can only be an odd number, right now, it's capped between 3 and 21. Consider changing it before drawing your pattern. The top bar of buttons has a refresh button, hit it after you decide on a grid size, the default 7 tends to work quite well.
    2. At the top left of the editor, there's a button for adding new chains, "\+ Add Chain."
    3. Clicking it brings up the dialog to select details about it. You need to select a Chain Tag, a Chain Shape Type and a Chain Color.
    4. Chain color is used for debug and in the UI to identify chains.
    5. Hit add, this will add the first chain to this new pattern.
    6. Now you can add a couple more or continue with drawing your first pattern.

       <Warning>
         If you reduce the size of the grid after drawing links in it, any links that don't fit the new bounds would be removed. For example, if you shift from Grid Size of 9 to 7 and have a link that's at the bottom right, left or top right of the grid, it will be removed since it won't fit the new bounds of the grid\!
       </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Drawing your pattern

<Accordion title="Drawing in GridCast" icon="brush">
  1. There's a drop down at the top to select a chain, if you just added a new chain, the first chain in the pattern will be selected automatically, use this to select between different chains if you have multiple ones in your pattern.
  2. After selecting a current chain, the input for drawing a shape depends on the shape type you pick. If you chain is of circle type, simply click any of the cells on the grid and a circle should appear there. Clicking again would remove the circle. This is how you draw for circle shaped patterns.
  3. If you chose Line as a shape, clicking a cell will first select the starting point of the line, clicking another cell will form a line pointing in it's direction. If you've already clicked to select a starting cell and then you click the starting cell again, it will cancel the line. If you want to remove a particular line, just click it's start cell and then the end cell. Basically draw it again on top of itself and it will be removed.
  4. The only thing that's really important to rememeber is the the sequence you draw the pattern in. Since it works based on array, the order you draw the points on the grid is the order they will be processed in. Refer to Processing Types for more details.
  5. That's it\! It really is that simple. Draw the kind of pattern you want, when you're done, save and you're ready to test the pattern.
  6. There's also a button to draw points randomly, it's not a complex method, feel free to play around with it.
</Accordion>

### Step 4: Testing your pattern

<Accordion title="Setup everything to spawn your pattern in the world" icon="wrench">
   1. Depending on what you want to be using this pattern, you want to add the GameplayTask component on that actor. For testing purposes, the default ThirdPerson blueprint character should be fine but you can also add it to your own player character if you have one.
   2. In the Event-graph, right click-\> "Execute GridCast." It's a gameplay task implemented specifically to handle the delay and everything else about the Pattern you have just drawn in a single node itself.
   3. You can configure the node however you wish, every parameter has as tooltip that explains what it does.
   4. It's an Async Gameplay Task, there's three 4 execution pins on the other side of the node. The top pin just continues execution once the task starts.
   5. PreExecute is what it sounds like, it'll fire at the start of the delay. It can be used to spawn telegraphs for the AoE effects, etc.
   6. Execute fires at the end of the delay, this is where you can do your gameplay logic like doing hit detection, dealing damage, spawning addtional things, etc.
   7. To make processing of data easier for users, there's a delegate based workflow that will neatly organize each of those steps and let you isolate each of those things separately based on the type of the shape.
   8. In the Event-graph, right click-\> "Process Grid Cast Output Chains." It's a node that was added specifically to solve the problem of having to manually loop through your pattern steps. The ideal way to work with it is to drag a pin from the red delegate pins and then search for "Create Event." A green node with a dropdown will come up.
   9. In the drop down, click the option for "Create Matching Function." Rename the function appropriately.
  10. Repeat that one time each for both PreExecute and Execute pins.
  11. Inside these newly created functions, you can spawn VFX, do hit detection, deal damage, anything you really want to do.
  12. Once you are down, you should be able to test the pattern by either using a debug input key or spawning it with any other methods.
