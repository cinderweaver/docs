## Button-row

All the really important and useful things about the editor are at the top, part of the default button-row.

## Add Chains

This is the button you press when you want to add a new chain to your pattern.

## Refresh Grid

By default, all drawning for slate which is what makes the editor windows, happens on tick and I didn't like the idea of doing a lot of heavy math on tick so I am cache data and only making updates when necessary.\
\
A side effect of this approach is that when you move the Grid Editor around or change GridSize, you have to manually hit this Refresh Grid button to refresh the grid. It's a good workflow habit to decide your grid size before you do anything else.

## Current Chain Selection

This dropdown uses the GameplayTags that you specify to identify a chain in a list to let you pick which chain should be currently edited.

## Clear Current Chain

Want to empty the current chain completely? Just click this button and it'll be reset.

## Clear All Chains

Does that Clear Current Chain does but for all the chains at once, very handy if you want to completely start over or if you are copy pasting your patterns after adding the chain and just want to change what the pattern looks like.
