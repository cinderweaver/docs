  <Accordion title="Base Grid Orientation" icon="grid">
    To understand the how rotation works, you need to know how the grid is being oriented.

    The grid pattern is **automatically rotated 90° clockwise** from its authored layout to align with character movement:

    - **Grid "Up" direction** → **Character Forward direction** (Yaw 0°)
    - **Grid "Right" direction** → **Character Right direction**

    This ensures that when you design a pattern pointing "up" in the grid editor, it will cast forward from the character in the game world.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotation Axis" icon="rotate">
    The axis around which the pattern spins.

    **Common Rotation Axes**:

    - **Vertical Spin**: `(0, 0, 1)` - Pattern spins like a ceiling fan (horizontal rotation)
    - **Side Roll**: `(1, 0, 0)` - Pattern rolls left/right like a wheel
    - **Forward Roll**: `(0, 1, 0)` - Pattern tumbles forward/backward
    - **Custom Diagonal**: `(1, 1, 0)` normalized - Creates unique spinning effects
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotation Speed" icon="spinner">
    GridCast doesn't have a tick. This is not degrees per second, it is degree per step. When you apply Rotation of 15 and -15, every next step in the pattern will have the rotation apply to them. It's much clearer once you see it happen below.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  The first step in the pattern's execution will not have any rotation applied to it. If you have a single-chain pattern and you set the mode to full-burst or chain sequential, then this rotation will do nothing.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  This doens't working with full-burst processing type.
</Warning>
